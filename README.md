# FixPluginTypesSerialization

Hook into the native Unity engine for adding BepInEx plugin assemblies into the assembly list that is normally used for the assemblies sitting in the game Managed/ folder.

This solve a bug where custom Serializable structs and such stored in plugin assemblies are not properly getting deserialized by the engine.

### Installation

- Copy the `BepInEx\patchers\FixPluginTypesSerialization` folder into your `BepInEx/patchers` folder.

### Adding your own Unity version support

This project only works with official releases of Unity 64 bit versions from 5.0.0 to 2023.2.5.

If you want to add your own version, know that I don't have the free time and the will to investigate on how to help you, all I can provide is the text below.

My best advice is to get ida or ghidra and get the unity pdb from their symbol servers (just google unity symbol server for that), and read the pseudo C code from the decompiler, find the assembly lists they populate from the Manager/ folder, and add the bepinex plugins/ assemblies to those assembly lists.

If the game uses custom Unity version or it's not supported and doesn't have pdb you can manually change offsets in the config. But it's not quite easy, your best bet would be getting the closest release verison that has pdb and open it in ida/ghidra find the funtions you need by name, then search for the bytes of the function in your Unity version. The start address of the function would be your offset (at least in ghydra just the address is not the offset, you would also need to look at the start of the file and sse the first address and subtract that from your function address to get the offset).

That's basically all this project does.

Be warned that Unity's implementation changes greatly from version to version, so you may have to completely change the way things are approached for suported versions.

An alternative path to messing with Unity internals directly is to investigate on how to setup a Virtual File System, other modding communities like Skyrim have done it for mod management purposes.

The idea is to redirect all system calls so that the bepinex plugin folder is as if it were in the Managed one.
